/**
 * The {@code LnfManager} manages the current look and feel of the riena (navigation) widgets.
 * <p>
 * The {@code LnfManager} has the term of a default look-and-feel (L&F). The default L&F is initially set by Riena to {@code RienaDefaultLnf}. But the default
 * L&F may also be overridden by frameworks based on Riena. That allows them to define their own default L&F.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Changing the L&F within a running application might result in system resources such as colors, fonts and images which will not be disposed.
 * <p>
 * However, applications can again override the default L&F. This can be done by either setting the system property "riena.lnf" or by specifying their L&F with
 * the methods {@code LnfManager.setLnf()}.
 * <p>
 * When specifying the L&F class via a string (either system property or one of the above mentioned methods) the string should conform to:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * lnf := [ Bundle-Symbolic-Name &quot;:&quot; ] LnF-Class-Name
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Where Bundle-Symbolic-Name allows to load the L&F class from the bundle with this symbolic name.<br>
 * If the Bundle-Symbolic-Name is omitted the {@code LnfManager} tries to load the Lnf class with the {LnfMangager}'s class loader.
